<h2>Causes of Dry Cough</h2>
<p>Several underlying reasons can trigger a dry cough. You must understand the cause of your dry coughing for effective dry cough treatment. Here are some of the common causes of dry coughs:</p>
<ul>
<li><h5>Asthma</h5>

<p>Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that is characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways. It leads to symptoms like wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing. A dry cough can be a major symptom of asthma. It especially happens during flare-ups or when exposed to asthmatic triggers like allergens or respiratory infections.</p>
</li>
<li><h5>GERD</h5>
<p>GERD or Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease is a disease where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus. It can cause irritation and inflammation. Chronic coughing is a common symptom of GERM. Especially if the dry cough starts after meals or at night, the stomach acid can irritate the throat and trigger a dry and persistent cough.</p>
</li>
<li><h5>Postnatal Drip</h5>
<p>Postnatal drip happens when excess mucus accumulates at the back of the throat and drips down the airways. This leads to irritation in the throat and coughing. Allergies, sinus infections, or colds are responsible dry cough causes especially when lying down or in the morning.</p>
</li>
<li><h5>Allergies</h5>
<p>If you are allergic to environmental triggers like pollen, dust mites, or pet dander, it can inflame the airways and trigger coughing. A dry cough is usually a major symptom of allergic reactions along with sneezing, nasal congestion, and itchy eyes.</p>
</li>
<li><h5>Viral Infection</h5>
<p>Viral infections like the common cold or influenza can cause inflammation in the upper respiratory tract. This is one of the dry cough causes as well. These coughs are temporary and go away on their own. However, they can be persistent and bothersome especially at night or after you wake up.</p>
</li>
<li><h5>Upper Respiratory Infection</h5>

<p>An upper respiratory infection can cause inflammation and irritation in the throat and airways which can lead to dry coughing. The hacking cough can be caused by bronchitis or laryngitis. These infections are usually teamed up with other symptoms like fever, fatigue, and nasal congestion.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Treatment Options</h2>
<p>Once you find out the cause of the dry cough, it gets easier to find the right dry cough treatment. Here are some treatment options you can consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use a humidifier if the air is dry for dry cough treatment. You can also breathe in steam to add moisture to the air. Both help soothe your irritated airways.</li>
<li>You can mix honey and lemon in warm water and drink it to help make your sore throat feel better and calm down the coughing.</li>
<li>You can also gargle with warm salt water for dry cough treatment. It helps reduce swelling in your throat and makes you cough less.</li>
<li>Make sure you get enough rest. The rest will help your body&rsquo;s immune system fight off sickness and help you heal faster. Getting rest can provide much-needed relief for dry cough.</li>
<li>If the home remedies listed above aren&rsquo;t available you can also take medicines for dry cough treatment. Cough suppressants are medicines that you can buy without a prescription.</li>
<li>You can also take expectorants which is a medicine that loosens up mucus in your throat for relief for dry cough.</li>
<li>Antihistamines are medicines that help with allergies. Take this medicine if your dry coughing is caused by an allergic reaction.</li>
<li>If you happen to have asthma, inhalers are a great way to open up your airways and make it easier for you to breathe. They can provide great relief for dry cough if you are asthmatic.</li>
